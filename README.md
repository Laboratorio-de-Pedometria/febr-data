# FEBR Data Processing

This repository contains scripts used to process the soil data from datasets published in the
Brazilian Soil Data Repository (FEBR, https://www.pedometria.org/febr/) until the end of 2019.
The data undergoes cleaning, standardization and, when possible, harmonization. The resulting
dataset is made available in a single TXT file for reuse, respecting the original data use licenses.
The scripts are written in R and use the `febr` package.
